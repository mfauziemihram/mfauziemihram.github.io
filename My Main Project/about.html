        Chelsea's regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. 
        The club's crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image. 
        The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s.
